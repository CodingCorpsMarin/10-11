jQuery really shines in DOM manipulation
The jQuery library has a variety of event handlers to choose from
99% of the time, need the page to fully load before executing any other commands
DOM elements (HTML tags) are selected and event handlers are called to “bind” these elements to a certain user-generated event
After the event is triggered, a callback function runs to execute an action
Many times jQuery events are coded to take the place of the default action, like submitting a form. This is achieved through the preventDefault() call
